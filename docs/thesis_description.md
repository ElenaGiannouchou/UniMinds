### Eleni Giannouchou - October 2025

# Abstract
This thesis deals with the design and development of an educational platform for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The main objective was to utilize technology and playful learning to make the learning experience more accessible, understandable, and enjoyable. The need for tools that are adapted to the specific cognitive and social needs of children with autism was the main motivation behind this effort.
\newline

The methodology followed initially involved a review of the relevant literature on special education and modern technological applications. Next, the user interface was designed with simplicity, accessibility, and ergonomics in mind, while educational games and videos were developed that focus on basic skills such as numerical thinking, understanding the value of money, and memory enhancement. In addition, the "Tips" section provides a space for parents and specialists to share experiences and practices, enhancing collaboration and mutual support.

The results of the implementation show that technology can be an ally in the educational process, creating a safe and enjoyable learning environment. The platform is not limited to simply providing activities, but also enhances children's autonomy and encourages their active participation. In this way, it contributes significantly to the effort to make learning a more positive and creative experience.

As for future developments, there are plans to enrich the platform with new games and videos covering more cognitive areas, activate the advice exchange feature, and add a system for monitoring each child's progress. These prospects reinforce the sustainability of the platform and show that it can evolve into a dynamic tool, valuable both for the educational community and for families of children with ASD.

# Introduction
The choice of topic for this thesis is not random. It arose from my personal need and desire to contribute in a practical way to the field of special education, and more specifically to the education of children with autism. Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects communication, social interaction, and often the behavior of children, making the learning process particularly challenging for them, their teachers, and their parents. 

The main reason I chose to develop a digital platform for educational content is the need for modern, accessible, and personalized tools that will make learning simpler, more understandable, and more enjoyable for children with autism. Through interactive activities, audiovisual material, and a user-friendly environment, the platform aims to strengthen basic skills such as attention, concentration, and comprehension. At the same time, it aims to boost children's autonomy and self-confidence by creating a learning environment where they feel they can succeed. 

The platform's capabilities are not limited to children but also extend to parents and educators. Through the tools and materials it offers, it can be used both at school and at home, facilitating the learning process. At the same time, the special "Tips" section allows parents, psychologists, and special education teachers to share experiences, practices, and observations that prove useful in supporting children with autism. Thus, the platform becomes a space not only for learning, but also for collaboration and knowledge exchange.

The significance of this effort lies in the fact that it uses technology not as an end in itself, but as a means to facilitate and enrich the educational process. The platform does not seek to replace the role of the teacher or specialist. Instead, its purpose is to provide support by offering new learning and development opportunities for children who need a more personalized approach. 

In the future, the platform will be enriched with more educational games covering different subjects, so that children can learn in a more creative and enjoyable way. At the same time, the addition of a scoring system will help parents and teachers monitor each child's progress. In addition, the games can be adapted to the specific needs of each student, taking into account the different levels of autism, as it is a spectrum with many unique manifestations.

# Results & Discussion

The platform combines educational games and videos designed to strengthen children's basic cognitive and social skills, such as understanding mathematical concepts, familiarizing themselves with money, and developing their memory. During the design process, particular emphasis was placed on the use of appropriate color combinations, easy-to-read fonts, and mild audiovisual stimuli, with the aim of creating a calm, clear, and friendly environment that meets the needs of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

One of the most essential features of the platform is that its games draw their content from familiar experiences of children. The activities are based on themes encountered at school or in everyday life, such as simple addition and subtraction, recognizing coins and banknotes, or matching images and concepts. This connection with the familiar reduces cognitive load and anxiety, while at the same time enhancing children's sense of security and participation in the learning process.

The content was developed in close collaboration with psychologist Maria Liapis, who provided expert scientific guidance on the educational needs of children with autism. Her observations and advice contributed significantly to improving the ergonomics and pedagogical suitability of the platform, especially in terms of the use of colors, the management of visual complexity, and the clarity of instructions.

The results of the implementation show that when technology is used in a targeted and pedagogically sensitive way, it can be a valuable tool in special education. It gives children equal opportunities to access knowledge, enhances their participation and autonomy, and contributes significantly to the creation of an inclusive learning environment.

Finally, the "Tips" section serves as a space for collaboration and support for parents, teachers, and specialists, promoting the exchange of experiences and best practices. In this way, the entire community surrounding the child is strengthened, making the platform not just an educational tool, but also a means of connection, understanding, and empathy.

# Conclusion

The aim of this project was to design and develop an interactive educational platform for children with autism, utilizing modern technologies and playful learning methods. Through a review of the literature and an analysis of the specific needs of children with ASD, an environment was designed that emphasizes simplicity, accessibility, and personalization of the user experience.

In summary, this work demonstrates that the combination of technology with playful learning and scientific documentation can contribute significantly to improving the educational experience of children with autism.

Future versions of the platform will include new games with greater thematic variety and increased difficulty. This will cover more educational needs, tailored to the different abilities and interests of children.
A language switching function will also be incorporated, allowing access to users from different linguistic backgrounds and expanding the platform's audience.

At the same time, additional educational material in the form of videos will be incorporated. Their topics will focus on everyday life, social interaction, and the development of autonomy skills, with the aim of applying knowledge in practice.

In addition, a "Tips" section will be activated, where users will be able to exchange experiences, ask questions, and receive support from both experts and other parents. This will strengthen the sense of community and cooperation.

Finally, there are plans to develop a system for monitoring the child's progress. This system will offer the possibility of better personalization of the learning experience, adapting teaching to the specific needs and pace of each child.

With these additions, the platform aims to evolve into a comprehensive learning and support ecosystem, specifically tailored to the needs of children with ASD and their families.
